# Brian Villegas Portfolio
Hello! I am Brian Villegas, a current student working to get his degree in Game Design and hoping to create amazing content!
This is my portfolio containing all my works, from College to work experience that can show my skills in the field. More particularly desciplinary areas.

## College Code Projects
Code Projects 
> These are the current projects I have done so far for my classes
### Random Number Generator project 
This was a project that required me to create random number generator as the header says
printing out a random number when cliking on the "Submit" button.

### Duck Guessing game
This is similar to the previous project, but the difference being that the number randomizes the number of ducks. 
Asking the user to submit a number that guesses how many ducks there are.

### Quick, Draw!
This is a mini project that required me to make a sort of pictonar type of game, but the catch is. You are the one drawing, but the AI is the thing trying to guess what you are drawing. Kind of like Akinator.

### Algorithmic Bias 
This project allowed me to see that you didn't need to be an expert in coding, it was all just about learning how you can explain yourself and what I was trying to explain. 
It is something that I learned in the future after I have used Javascript and style to improve upon it, it's not the prettiest thing in the world. However, it is something that I am proud of.
The overall reason for the project is to discuss the problem with algorithmic bias, mostly for the reason that now a days. Companies are starting to use AI more during the hiring process or AI to actually take up the job of someone else.
Making it a very big problem for mistakes and even less jobs being available, leading people to scramble for any jobs that have not been taken over by AI.
